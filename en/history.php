            <img src="../assets/images/dest/story-images/808e755.png" alt="Frank Hornby" title="Фрэнк Хорнби" class="history-images inventor" />
            <p class="text-indent">Frank Hornby (Frank Hornby) - English inventor of the very first tinker toy, businessman and politician. The toy companies he founded made him a millionaire, but more importantly, he gave a wealth of new experiences to many generations of children. Toys that really develop real useful skills ... It was he who, under the impression of the achievements of the XIX – XX century, had the idea to create a design kit, which consisted of metal plates with holes drilled at equal distances, screws and nuts for fastening.</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/dest/story-images/324f7c51ab47382b96987ad733d8a180.png" alt="First constructor" title="The first tinker toy"
                class="history-images" /><br>
            <p class="text-indent">There were many other details in this constructor: brackets, wheels, gears, electric motors... Mandatory attachments and tools, first of all screwdrivers and wrenches ... every child could use imagination and create a whole city with bridges, cars, airplanes and even flying plates. Named the product as follows: "An improved toy or device for teaching children and adolescents." Soon, a new toy called the Meccano tinker toy gained extraordinary popularity. And the author, who quickly became a millionaire, wrote a book about himself, which he entitled: “The guy who earned $ 1,000,000 with a toy” ...</p>
            <p class="text-indent">Children's tinker toys are considered to be a universal textbook that develops hand motor skills, thinking, memory, imagination, as well as many other skills that will be useful to a child in the future. It is known that the level of development of the child is directly dependent on the degree of formation of subtle movements of the fingers.</p>

            <p class="text-indent">Under this brand, tinker toys are still produced, but now the company produces not only metal toys, but also toys for kids from soft, bending plastic with bright large parts for quick and easy assembly and an exciting game.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">Much more lately the invention, but not inferior in popularity to the first Meccano tinker toy, is the Lego, who invented Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1949. In 1963, plastic was used to make Lego. Today, Lego is one of the most popular tinker toys in the world, and, like Meccano, suggests options for children of different ages with different hobbies.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/dest/story-images/fcdf51.jpg" alt="Lego" title="Lego tinker toy" class="history-images" /><br>
            <p class="text-indent">For kids, there is Lego Duplo (Lego Duplo), the details of which are twice the standard. And in the Lego Duplo series there is a special construction plate to make the construction easier to fix. For older children, there is the Lego Systems series - these are sets of classic Lego parts for building fairly simple models, the subject of which is not much different from the subjects of the Duplo sets. The main difference here is in the size of the parts and in the fact that the design is already proposed more consciously. A construction plate is also offered for the System series kits.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">For those who have already mastered Lego and managed to become attached to the design, there are Lego Creator universal thematic kits - one set for creating several models, Lego Star Wars for creating models on the super popular movie Star Wars theme, Lego City - tinker toys for building a metropolis with all imaginable infrastructure, including, for example, a cosmodrome. The Lego Technic series will interest fans of realistic transport models, and you will definitely have to make an effort to assemble them.</p>

            <p class="text-indent">But "toy" progress does not lag behind the scientific progress, and therefore, there are so-called scientific and educational tinker toys. They are fundamentally different from those presented above in that, besides, in fact, the design of mechanical models offers to become familiar with such phenomena as magnetism, electricity, wind, water, sun, as well as the physical properties of objects and many others. And the Gigo brand tinker toys give the chance also to carry out the corresponding experiments. Such scientific toys not only develop imagination and spatial thinking, but are a full-fledged educational tool, offering to study serious "adult" topics in a playful way, clearly and easily.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/dest/story-images/6b9f94.png" alt="Gigo" title="Gigo tinker toy" class="history-images" /><br>
            <p class="text-indent">Robot tinker toys give an idea of the rapidly developing robotics today and allow you to create real robots, for example, from ... used tin cans.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/dest/story-images/a6ad6b.png" alt="Robot" title="Robotic tinker toy" class="history-images" /><br>
            <p class="text-indent">And here is another brand of unusual tinker toys, offering you to use empty boxes, all sorts of plastic packaging, obsolete CDs and all the unnecessary things that come to mind - Makedo tinker toys. For example, here is the original packaging recycling :)</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/dest/story-images/449898.png" alt="Makedo" title="Makedo tinker toy" class="history-images" /><br>
            <p class="text-indent">And another interesting tinker toy, the creation of which was probably inspired by the aesthetics of modern art. Zolo tinker toys are obviously different from all the toys presented above in that they are not designed to recreate anything from the real world - this is such an ideal simulator of wild imagination.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/dest/story-images/a265aee48e.jpg" alt="Zolo" title="Zolo tinker toy" class="history-images" /><br>
            <p class="text-indent">In principle, the opposite of the Zolo tinker toy in the sense of the greatest realism, probably, are ceramic tinker toys, or tinker toys with bricks. The meaning of these tinker toys is that you can build a very realistic small building out of real mini-bricks with the help of a real and completely harmless for children building mixture.</p>
